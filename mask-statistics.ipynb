    "This notebook shows how can we extract statistical information from an image (e.g. finding the maximal intensity in a desired region of interest). The steps that we need to follow to achieve this mainly depend on the exact problem we want to solve but in general it consists of: \n",
    "    Step 1: load and read the image\n",
    "    Step 2: pre-process the image if necessary such as noise filtering\n",
    "    Step 3: find the region of interest: edge or inside the region? \n",
    "    Step 4: extract the desired information in the region of interest: mean, max, min, sum, median, mode, ...\n",
    "    Step 5: display/plot results\n",
    "    Step 6: save the plots in a given image format or values in a text/excel file"
